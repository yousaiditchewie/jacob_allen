          <div class="modal-content">
            <h4>Terms of Service</h4>
            <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of Crityk, including any Crityk mobile applications and websites (the "Services"), and any videos, information, text, graphics, photos or other materials uploaded, downloaded or appearing on the Services (collectively referred to herein as "Content"). Your access to and use of the Services is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
1. Basic Terms.  You are responsible for your use of the Services, for any Content you post to the Services, and for any consequences resulting therefrom. The Content you submit, post, or display will be able to be viewed by other users of the Services and through third party services and websites. You should only provide Content that you are willing to share with others under these Terms.
You may use the Services only if you can form a binding contract with Crityk and are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction. If you are accepting these Terms and using the Services on behalf of a company, organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so. You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations.
The Services that Crityk provides are always evolving and the form and nature of the Services that Crityk provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you. In addition, Crityk may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally and may not be able to provide you with prior notice. We also retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time without notice to you.
2. Privacy. Any information that you provide to Crityk is subject to our Privacy Policy, which governs our collection and use of your information. You understand that through your use of the Services you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of this information, including the transfer of this information to the United States and/or other countries for storage, processing and use by Crityk. As part of providing you the Services, we may need to provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and your Crityk account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving.
3. Passwords. You are responsible for safeguarding the password or credentials that you use to access the Services and for any activities or actions under your account. We encourage you to use "strong" passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account and with other accounts that you may connect to your Crityk account (such as Twitter or your email). Crityk cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements.
4. Content on the Services. All Content, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, is the sole responsibility of the person who originated such Content. We may, but are not required to monitor or control the Content posted via the Services and we cannot take responsibility for such Content. Any use or reliance on any Content or materials posted via the Services or obtained by you through the Services is at your own risk.
We do not endorse, support, represent or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any Content or communications posted via the Services or endorse any opinions expressed via the Services. You understand that by using the Services, you may be exposed to Content that might be offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate, or in some cases, postings that have been mislabeled or are otherwise deceptive. Under no circumstances will Crityk be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any Content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Services or broadcast elsewhere.
5. Ownership of Content. All Content you submit to Crityk becomes the sole and exclusive property of Crityk. _______________________________________
As the owner of the Content, Crityk has the right to provide, promote, and to make Content submitted to or through the Services available to other companies, organizations or individuals who partner with Crityk for the syndication, broadcast, distribution or publication of such Content on other media and services, subject to our terms and conditions for such Content use. Such additional uses by Crityk, or other companies, organizations or individuals who partner with Crityk, may be made with no compensation paid to you with respect to the Content that you submit, post, transmit or otherwise make available through the Services.
We may modify or adapt your Content in order to transmit, display or distribute it over computer networks and in various media and/or make changes to your Content as are necessary to conform and adapt that Content to any requirements or limitations of any networks, devices, services or media.
You are responsible for your use of the Services, for any Content you provide, and for any consequences thereof, including the use of your Content by other users and our third party partners. You understand that your Content may be syndicated, broadcast, distributed, or published by our partners and if you do not have the right to submit Content for such use, it may subject you to liability. Crityk will not be responsible or liable for any use of your Content by Crityk in accordance with these Terms. You represent and warrant that you have all the rights, power and authority necessary to grant the rights granted herein to any Content that you submit.
6. Ownership of the Services. All right, title, and interest in and to the Services (excluding Content provided by users) are and will remain the exclusive property of Crityk and its licensors. The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign countries. Crityk reserves all rights not expressly granted in these Terms.

8. Restrictions on Content and Use of the Services. We reserve the right at all times (but will not have an obligation) to remove or refuse to distribute any Content on the Services, to suspend or terminate users, and to reclaim usernames and profile URLs without liability to you. The Crityk Rules  (which are part of these Terms) further detail what is prohibited on the Services.
We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce the Terms, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property or safety of Crityk, its users and the public. Crityk does not disclose personally identifying information to third parties except in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
You may not do any of the following while accessing or using the Services: (i) access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Services, Crityk's computer systems, or the technical delivery systems of Crityk's providers; (ii) probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network or breach or circumvent any security or authentication measures; (iii) access or search or attempt to access or search the Services by any means (automated or otherwise) other than through our currently available, published interfaces that are provided by Crityk (and only pursuant to those terms and conditions); (iv) forge any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any email or posting, or in any way use the Services to send altered, deceptive or false source-identifying information; or (v) interfere with, or disrupt, (or attempt to do so), the access of any user, host or network, including, without limitation, sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, mail-bombing the Services, or by scripting the creation of Content in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on the Services.
9. Copyright Policy. Crityk respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects users of the Services to do the same. We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us. If you believe that your Content has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information: (i) a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf; (ii) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed; (iii) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material; (iv) your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address; (v) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.
We reserve the right to remove Content alleged to be infringing without prior notice and at our sole discretion. In appropriate circumstances, Crityk will also terminate a user's account if the user is determined to be a repeat infringer. Our designated copyright agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement appearing on the Services is:
Copyright Agent - Crityk Email: copyright@crityk.com
10. Termination. The Terms will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Crityk as follows. You may end your legal agreement with Crityk at any time for any reason by deactivating your accounts and discontinuing your use of the Services.
We may suspend or terminate your accounts or cease providing you with all or part of the Services at any time for any reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms, (ii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; or (iii) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the email address associated with your account or through the Services the next time you attempt to access your account.
In all such cases, the Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation, your license to use the Services, except that the following sections shall continue to apply: 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12.
Nothing in this section shall affect Crityk's rights to change, limit or stop the provision of the Services without prior notice, as provided above in section 1.

11. Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability. Please read this section carefully since it limits the liability of Crityk and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, related companies, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, partners, and licensors (collectively, the "Crityk Entities"). Each of the subsections below only applies up to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, and as a result the contents of this section may not apply to you. Nothing in this section is intended to limit any rights you may have which may not be lawfully limited.

The Crityk Rules
Our goal is to provide a service that allows you to discover and receive content from sources that interest you as well as to share your content with others. We respect the ownership of the content that users share and each user is responsible for the content he or she provides. Because of these principles, we do not actively monitor user content and will not censor user content, except in limited circumstances described below.
Content Boundaries and Use of Crityk
In order to provide the Crityk service and the ability to communicate and stay connected with others, there are some limitations on the type of content that may be published with Crityk. These limitations comply with legal requirements and make Crityk a better experience for all. Crityk may update or modify the Content Boundaries of Use from time to time by posting the changes on this site.
Impersonation: Accounts portraying others in a manner that does or is intended to mislead, confuse, or deceive others may be permanently suspended.
Trademark: Use of a company or business name, logo, or other trademark-protected material in a manner that misleads or confuses others with regard to its brand or business affiliation may be considered a violation.
Private information: You may not publish or post other people's private and confidential information, such as credit card numbers, street address or Social Security/National Identity numbers, without their express authorization.
Sensitive Media: Sensitive media, such as nudity or mild violence, may be subject to certain limitations.
Explicit Graphic Content: You may not publish or post explicit violent or otherwise graphic content, such as explicit depictions of child abuse, animal abuse, or bodily harm.
Pornography and Sexually Explicit Content: You may not post content that is pornographic or sexually explicit—even if it is of yourself or marked as sensitive.
Threats: You may not publish or post content that is intended to incite others to commit violence, mocks victims of violence, or includes a direct and specific threat of violence to others.
Copyright: We will respond to valid and complete notices of alleged copyright infringement. Our copyright procedures are set forth in the Terms of Service.
Unlawful Use: You may not use our service for any unlawful purposes or in furtherance of illegal activities. International users agree to comply with all local laws regarding online conduct and acceptable content.
Spam and Abuse
Crityk strives to protect its users from spam and abuse. Technical abuse and user abuse are not tolerated on Crityk and may result in permanent suspension.
Serial Accounts: You may not create serial accounts for disruptive or abusive purposes, or with overlapping use cases. Mass account creation may result in suspension of all related accounts.
Profile URL Squatting: You may not engage in profile URL squatting. Accounts that are inactive for more than six months may also have their profile URLs removed or reclaimed without further notice. Some of the factors that we take into account when determining what conduct is considered to be profile URL squatting are:
the number of profile URLs created;
creating profile URLs for the purpose of preventing others from using those profile URL names;
creating profile URLs for the purpose of selling those profile URLs.
Invitation spam: You may not use any of the “Find People” (address book contact importer, Twitter contact importer, invite via email, and invite via text) or “Share” features to send repeat, mass invitations.
Selling accounts: You may not purchase or sell Crityk accounts.
Malware/Phishing: You may not publish or link to malicious content intended to damage or disrupt another user’s browser or computer, or to compromise a user’s privacy or login information.
Spam: You may not use the Crityk service for the purpose of spamming anyone. Some of the factors that we take into account when determining what conduct is considered to be spamming are:
Crityk posts:
If you post Crityk videos with the sole purpose of directing users to an external site or service, particularly if the service advertised is in the business of buying/selling account interactions (followers, “Likes”, etc);
If you post Crityk videos with deliberately misleading tags or channels;
If you post multiple unrelated Crityk videos to a hashtag, particularly hashtags surfaced in the Explore tab;
If you post duplicate Crityk videos over multiple accounts or multiple duplicate Crityks on one account;
If you purchase “Likes” or re-Crityks in an attempt to increase the popularity of your content, through automated or other means;
If you use serial accounts to auto re-Crityk your content to increase its popularity.
Post interactions:
If a disproportionate number of users flag your content;
If a disproportionate number of your comments have been deleted;
If a disproportionate number of users are blocking your profile;
If a disproportionate number of users are reporting your profile for spam;
If you post large numbers of duplicate comments;
If you post large numbers of unsolicited comments in an attempt to advertise a service or link;
If you “Like” a large number of Crityk videos in an attempt to attract attention to a profile;
If you re-Crityk a large number of Crityk videos in an attempt to attract attention to a profile;
If you trade “Likes” for re-Crityks with other users;
If you repeatedly re-Crityk and un-re-Crityk in an attempt to attract attention to a profile.
Following behaviors:
If you have followed a large number of users in a short time period;
If you have followed and un-followed the same users in a short time period, particularly by automated means (aggressive follower churn);
If you repeatedly follow and un-follow users;
If you have a small number of followers compared to the amount of people you are following;
Creating or purchasing accounts in order to gain followers;
Using or promoting third-party sites or services that claim to get you more followers (such as follower trains, sites promising "more followers fast," or any other site or service that offers to automatically add followers to your profile).
Profile Images: You may not use obscene or pornographic images in your profile photo.
Accounts engaging in any of the activities specified above may be subject to permanent suspension.</p>

            <h4>Privacy Policy</h4>
            <p>Privacy Policy
(SKS Solutions, LLC, creator of the CRITYK App)
http://crityk.com
This Privacy Policy is effective as of April 11, 2016.
Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or in connection with using the Crityk website or Crityk application services (collectively, the “Service“), and your choices about the collection and use of your information.
By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post content, including photos, comments and other materials (“User Content“), to the Service and to share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found here www.Critykapp.com/terms).
Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (“Users“).
What information do we collect?
Information you submit directly:
Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for a Crityk account.
Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, profile picture, bio description, username, and phone number). This information allows us to help you or others be “found” on Crityk.
Information from social media accounts you connect (e.g. email address, profile pictures, usernames, and credentials)
User Content (e.g., photos, comments, ratings, location, and other materials) that you post to the Service.
Communications between you and SKS Solutions or Crityk. For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.
Locating and Inviting your friends on Crityk:
If you choose to find or invite your friends through your device’s contacts list, then Crityk will access your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using Crityk.
If you choose to find or invite your friends through a third-party social media site, then you will be prompted to set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that any information that such service may provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.
If you choose to find your friends through a search of names or usernames on Crityk then simply type a name to search and we will perform a search on our Service.
Note about “Invite Friends” feature:If you choose to invite someone to the Service through our “Invite friends” feature, you may select a person directly from the contacts list on your device and send a text or email from your personal account. You understand and agree that you are responsible for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this invitation is coming directly from your personal account, Crityk does not have access to or control this communication.
Analytics information:
We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service.
Cookies and similar technologies:
When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information about how you use Crityk and provide features to you.
Device identifiers:
When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Crityk.
A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help others or us provide reports or personalized content in the future. Information collected through device identifiers may include device locations, including specific geographic locations, such as through GPS, Bluetooth, or WiFi signals utilized on your device. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.
Metadata:
Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted.
Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo or comment), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive.
How do we use your information?
In addition to some of the specific uses we outline in this Privacy Policy, we may use information that we receive to do the following:
fulfill customer support requests
help you efficiently access your information after you sign in
remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Service;
provide personalized content and information to you and others, this may be based on your location and/or preferences provided to us during your usage
provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service

Please remember that the information you post to the Service is intended for public consumption, including your reviews, photos, comments, likes, friends, lists, and account profile. We may display this information on the Service, share it with businesses, and further distribute it to a wider audience through third party sites and services.
How and with whom do we share your information?
We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside SKS Solutions without your consent, except as noted in this Policy.
We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information from cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally part of the same group of companies that SKS Solutions is part of, or that become part of that group (“Affiliates”). Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service (including by providing analytics) and Affiliates’ own services (including by providing you with better and more relevant experiences).
We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to you (“Service Providers”). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.
We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymous data with other parties. We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer associated with you and share that aggregated information.
Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:
Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the public. Once you have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.
Any User Content that you make public is searchable by other Users and subject to re-use.
If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other Users or third parties using Crityk have copied, shared, or saved that information.
What happens in the event of a change of control?
If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of SKS Solutions or our assets to another organization (e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation), your information such as name and email address, User Content and any other information collected through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User Content. The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy.
Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:
We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you may be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.
How do we store and protect your information?
Storage and Processing:
Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which SKS Solutions or its Affiliates or Service Providers maintain facilities.
SKS Solutions, its Affiliates, or Service Providers may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.
By registering for and using the Service you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or to any other country in which SKS Solutions, its Affiliates or Service Providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.
We use commercially reasonable safeguards to help keep the information collected through the Service secure and take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. However, SKS Solutions cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to Toast Labs or Crityk or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.
Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes the social media services you connect to Crityk make to their services. We are not responsible for the functionality, privacy, or security measures of any other organization.
What are your choices about the use of your information?
Your account information and profile/privacy settings:
Update your account at any time by logging in and changing your profile settings.
Unsubscribe from email communications from us by clicking on the “unsubscribe link” provided in such communications. As noted above, you may not opt out of Service-related communications (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices).
How long do we keep your User Content?
Following termination or deactivation of your account, SKS Solutions, Crityk, its Affiliates, or its Service Providers may retain information (including your profile information) and User Content for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, and/or audit purposes.
Security
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Children’s Privacy
SKS Solutions and Crityk do not knowingly collect or solicit any information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the Service. The Service and its content are not directed at children under the age of 13. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us.
Other Web Sites and Services
We are not responsible for the practices employed by any websites or services linked to or from our Service, including the information or content contained within them. Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Service to another website or service, our Privacy Policy does not apply to those third-party websites or services. Your browsing and interaction on any third-party website or service, including those that have a link on our website, are subject to that third party’s own rules and policies. In addition, you agree that we are not responsible and do not have control over any third-parties that you authorize to access your User Content. If you are using a third-party website or service and you allow them to access your User Content you do so at your own risk.
